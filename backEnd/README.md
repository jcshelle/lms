## Conda

Activate the environment after you create the environment: `conda activate lms`.
Create an environment from the .yaml `conda env create --file environment.yaml`.
Install new dependencies: `conda env update --file local.yml`.
Add a new dependency: `conda install packageName`.
You've gotta update the environment.yaml by hand though.

Note for windows users: Conda will not work with powershell :(

## Serving with Flask

In the /frontEnd directory, run `npm run build`.
After this command, you should notice that the static and templates folders are populated.
Now, in the /backEnd directory, run `python3 app.py`.
The application should be available at the IP and port specified in the app.py.
